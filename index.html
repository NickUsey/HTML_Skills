    <h2>About The Siberian Husky</h2>
        <p>The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed.<br>
           The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family.<br>
           It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect <br>
           triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than<br> 
           the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi<br> 
           people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia.<br>
           They were brought Nome, Alaska in 1908 to serve as working sled<br> 
           dogs, and were eventually developed and used for sled dog racing</p>
    <h3>Physical Features</h3>
    <h4>Coat</h4>
        <p>A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds.<br>
           It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thiker, straight<br>
           guard hairs.</p>
    <h4>Eyes</h4>
        <p>the AKC describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as "an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely."<br>
           The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue or black; one of each or particoloured are acceptable<br>
           <strong><em>(Complete is heterochromia)</em></strong>. These eye-color combinations are considered acceptable by the AKC. The parti-color<br>
           does not affect the vision of the dog.</p>
    <h4>Tail</h4>
        <p>Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses<br>
           in order to provide additional warmth. When curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth,<br>
           often referred to as the <strong><em>"Siberian Swirl"</em></strong>. The AKC recommends the tail should be expressive, held low when the dog<br>
           is relaxed, and curved upward in a "sickle" shape when excited or interested in something.</p>
    <h4>Size</h4>
        <p>The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between 20 and 24 inches<br>
           <strong>(51 and 61 cm)</strong> tall at the withers and weighing between 45 and 60 pounds <strong>(20 and 27 kg)</strong>. Females are smaller,<br>
           growing to between 19 and 23 inches <strong>(48 and 58 cm)</strong> tall at the withers and weighing between 35 and 50 pounds<br>
           <strong>(16 and 23 kg)</strong>. The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies as "Siberian Rats" due to their size of<br>
           40-50 lb <strong>(18-23 kg)</strong>, versus the Alaskan Malamute's size of 75-85 lb <strong>(34-39 kg)</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Personality</h4>
        <p>The Husky usually howls instead of barking. They have been described as escape artists,<br>
           which can include digging under, chewing through, or even jumping over fences.<br><br>

           Because the Siberian Husky had been raised in a family setting by the Chukchi and<br>
           not left to fend for themselves, they could be trusted with children. The ASPCA<br>
           classifies the breed as good with children. It also states they exhibit high energy<br>
           indoors, have special exercise needs, and may be destructive "without proper care".<br><br>
            
           Siberian Huskies have a high prey drive due to the Chukchi allowing them to roam free in the summer.<br>
           The dogs hunted in packs and preyed on wild cats, birds, and squirrels, but with training can be trusted<br>
           with other small animals. They would only return to the Chukchi villages when the snow returned and food<br>
           became scarce. Their hunting instincts can still be found in the breed today, noted by their typically high prey-drive</p>
